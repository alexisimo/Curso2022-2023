# Hands-on assignment 5 â€“ Self assessment

## Checklist

**Every RDF file:**

- [X] Has at least one owl:sameAs property that links to another dataset

## Comments on the self-assessment

- All members of the group have participated equally in the development of the files and testing of the ontology.

- Because the moodle descritpion of the assignment was not the same as the one in the slides, we decided to upload the files with the format described in the slides, although we only made one mapping for both datasets as described in the moodle assignment.
